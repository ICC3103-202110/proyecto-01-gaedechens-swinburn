Asumtions

  Log
        The log of the game doesn’t keep track of the players that an action was done to, it only states the actions that were done by the players. This way, the player that was paying attention has the advantage.


  Dealer      
        You get random card from a deck, so you can get the same hero twice
 

  Assasinations
        One player can assasinate what ever player he choses from the board, including himself.

        If aplayer doesnt have enough coins to kill someone but decided to commit an assasination, then he looses his turn. 

        You can target players that doint have heros, so beware of who you attack.

        If someone tries to kill one of your influence cards with the Assassin and you don't respond with a valid option from the menu (it's a bluff, it's not a bluff, counter with Contessa), the action will take place and you will lose an influence.

        You cannot pick an empty hero to assassinate. That’s cheating.


  Captain
        If someone steals from you, another player can save you first by blocking that move!, before you even have to doubt it, but you will still be provided with the option to dount it!

        If you have the Captain, you cannot steal coins from someone that does not have any. If this happens, the program will crash.
      

  Ambassador
        In order to use the Ambassador’s action, exchange, you have to have the Ambassador as one of your influence cards. Otherwise, a player could exchange their cards with the deck too easily. In other words, you cannot bluff having the Ambassador.
